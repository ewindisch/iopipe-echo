# Simple "echo" script for iopipe

A function which returns its input. This
is provided as a basic demonstration for iopipe.

As per iopipe module symantics, module.exports is
defined as a function.

# Usage example:

```javascript
var iopipe = require("iopipe")
var echo = require("iopipe-echo")

iopipe.define(echo, console.log)("hello world")
```

This is equivilent to simply passing "hello world"
to console.log(), oriopipe.define(console.log)("hello world").

Basically, this module offers a complete noop function. It
is completely useless except to serve as an example (and test).
